<h3>description</h3>
<p>
EVENT_DISPATCH sets up event notifications for the current figure. If
no figure exist a new one will be created.
</p>
<p>
EVENT_DISPATCH ON sets up the current figure for event notifications.
</p>
<p>
EVENT_DISPATCH OFF removes event notification framework from currrent
figure
</p>
<p>
EVENT_DISPATCH CLEAR disables mouse event notifications in all open
figures and removes all evidence of the framework
</p>
<p>
EVENT_DISPATCH(hFig) sets up event notifications for specified figure
</p>
<p>
EVENT_DISPATCH(hFig, command) runs command ('on', 'off', 'clear') for
specified figure
</p>
<p>
hFig=EVENT_DISPATCH( ... ) returns figure handle.
</p>
<p>
This event notification framework runs parallel to the native Matlab
handle graphics object callbacks like 'Callback', 'ButtonDownFcn',
'KeyPressFcn'. The framework only works for graphical objects on the
figure canvas (so called canvas objects, i.e. the figure itself,
uipanels, axes and children of axes), but NOT on any object that has
an underlying Java component that handles the events (i.e. uicontrols,
uitree, etc.).
</p>
<p>
The following event callbacks exist:
<dl>
<dt>MyButtonDownFcn</dt><dd>called when a mouse button is pressed</dd>
<dt>MyButtonUpFcn</dt><dd>called when a mouse button is released</dd>
<dt>MyWheelMovedFcn</dt><dd>called when mouse wheel moved</dd>
<dt>MyStartDragFcn</dt><dd>called when a drag operation starts</dd>
<dt>MyStopDragFcn</dt><dd>called when a drag operation ends</dd>
<dt>MyDragFcn</dt><dd>called when mouse is dragged</dd>
<dt>MyKeyPressFcn</dt><dd>called when a key is pressed</dd>
<dt>MyKeyreleaseFcn</dt><dd>called when key is released</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
Event handling can be turned on for a graphical object by calling
enable_events. For every canvas object event callbacks can be set and
retrieved using the Matlab SET and GET commands. Alternatively, these
properties can be set or removed using the helper functions
ADD_CALLBACK and REMOVE_CALLBACK.
</p>
<p>
A callback can be any of the following:
<ol>
<li>A string, which will evaluated in the base workspace. Since Matlab's gcbo function to get the current callback object doesn't work properly with this event framework, a temporary variable called gcbo is created in the base workspace and it is assigned the callback object's handle.</li>
<li>A function handle or a cell array with the first cell either a function name or a function handle. The remaining cells in the cell array are optional user defined extra arguments that are passed on to the callback function. The signature of a callback function is: success = fcn( hObj, eventdata, ... extra arguments ...)</li>
<li>A nx2 cell array of multiple callbacks. The first column of cells contains a string (as under 1.) or a callback function (as under 2.) and the second column of cells contains a ID to indentify the callback function. The ADD_CALLBACK and REMOVE_CALLBACK functions can be used to add and remove callback from this cell array.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The first argument of a callback function is the handle of the object
that receives the event notification (i.e. the callback object). The
second argument is an event data structure, with information about the
event. The structure is translated from Java by Matlab with the
following fields (this is only a partial list and not all field are
present for each type of event):
<dl>
<dt>AltDown</dt><dd>'on'/'off' state of alt-key</dd>
<dt>Button</dt><dd>which mouse button was pressed/released or started dragging</dd>
<dt>ControlDown</dt><dd>'on'/'off' state of control-key</dd>
<dt>KeyChar</dt><dd>character representation of key press</dd>
<dt>KeyCode</dt><dd>key code</dd>
<dt>MetaDown</dt><dd>'on'/'off' state of meta-key</dd>
<dt>Modifiers</dt><dd>state of modifier keys and buttons that changed state</dd>
<dt>ModifiersEx</dt><dd>state of modifier keys and buttons</dd>
<dt>Point</dt><dd>x,y pixel coordinates of point clicked</dd>
<dt>ShiftDown</dt><dd>'on'/'off' state of shift-key</dd>
<dt>WheelRotation</dt><dd>wheel rotation steps (positive or negative)</dd>
<dt>When</dt><dd>event timestamp The framework adds the following extra fields to the event data structure:</dd>
<dt>HitObject</dt><dd>handle of the object that was directly under the mouse cursor when the event occurred and had its HitTest property set to 1. During dragging, HitObject is set to the object where dragging started</dd>
<dt>HitPoint</dt><dd>local x,y coordinates of mouse cursor location (in HitObject coordinates)</dd>
<dt>ClickedPoint</dt><dd>local x,y coordinates of mouse cursor location at the time of mouse press/release. While dragging ClickedPoint contains the coordinates of the point where dragging started.</dd>
<dt>Dragging</dt><dd>0/1 indicates if the mouse is being dragged or not</dd>
<dt>ActiveButtons</dt><dd>All pressed buttons</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
The event dispatcher finds the object under the mouse cursor using
Matlab's hittest function. This means that if an object has its
HitTest property set to 0, it will be unable to receive events. The
event dispatcher uses the following rules to determine which object
will receive the event notification (and thus which callback function
are being executed):
MyButtonDown, MyButtonUp, MyWheelMoved events are sent to the object
directly beneath the mouse cursor.
MyKeyPress, MyKeyRelease events are sent to the figure's current
object. If there is no current object, then it will be sent to the
current axes. If there is no current axes, the event will be sent to
the figure.
MyStartDrag, MyDrag, MyStopDrag events are all sent to the object
where dragging started
</p>
<p>
Note that while dragging, all MyButtonDown, MyButtonUp and
MyWheelMoved events are directed to the object where the drag
operation started. For example, when a drag operation was started in
the figure, but the mouse cursor was dragged over an axes, then still
the figure will receive all drag related events and any additional
MyButtonDown, MyButtonUp and MyWheelMoved events. For this example,
the extra eventdata structure fields will contain the following:
<dl>
<dt>HitObject</dt><dd>figure handle</dd>
<dt>HitPoint</dt><dd>current mouse cursor location in figure coordinates</dd>
<dt>ClickedObject</dt><dd>figure handle</dd>
<dt>ClickedPoint</dt><dd>mouse cursor location at time of first mouse press in figure (in figure coordinates)</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
For objects that are descendents of an axes (i.e. plotting objects),
the event notification will propagate up the hierarchy to the parent
axes until the event is succesfully processed. Thus if a plotting
object has no callbacks, then its parent will receive the event
next. If any callback is a string or a function with no output
arguments, then it is assumed that the event was successfully
processed and the event does not propagate any further. Callback
functions that do return an output argument have control over the
propagation: if they return false, the event wasn't processed and if
they return true the event was processed. For example if a patch
object responds to left button clicks, it could test for the button
pressed in its MyButtonUp callback and if any other button than the
left obe was pressed it would return false, so that it parent axes can
have a chance to process it (for example because the axes responds to
a right button click).
